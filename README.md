INTRODUCTION
“Mutative Chroman” is a pixel action-adventure game that merges the elements of side-scrolling and platforming that tells the whole story of a chameleon subject who is trying to escape from the lab by engaging in combat with mutated animals and robotic adversaries. The game features advanced enemies and incorporates a unique mechanic of color change for stealth tactics and the acquisition of new abilities.

STORY
The game starts when a chameleon, changed by experiments, breaks free from its tube. The story is told through mutated animals and robots that talk about what they've gone through. Each character has its own story. In the end, we find out the whole game was an experiment to make the chameleon as powerful as possible.

DESCRIPTION
