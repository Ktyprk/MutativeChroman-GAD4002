Genre: 2D Pixel Art, Action-Adventure, Side-Scroller, Platformer, Metroidvania          
Platform: PC

INTRODUCTION           
“Mutative Chroman” is a pixel action-adventure game that merges the elements of side-scrolling and platforming that tells the whole story of a chameleon subject who is trying to escape from the lab by engaging in combat with mutated animals and robotic adversaries. The game features advanced enemies and incorporates a unique mechanic of color change for stealth tactics and the acquisition of new abilities.

STORY          
The game starts when a chameleon, changed by experiments, breaks free from its tube. The story is told through mutated animals and robots that talk about what they've gone through. Each character has its own story. In the end, we find out the whole game was an experiment to make the chameleon as powerful as possible.

DESCRIPTION          
Mutative Chroman is a game centered around the core mechanics of exploration, puzzlesolving, and character enhancement. As players embark on their escape journey, they will engage with NPCs, unraveling the secrets of the laboratory and obtaining crucial information on how to break free. The game's structure includes lab rooms, where players undergo modifications, and each successful exploration contributes to character development.
